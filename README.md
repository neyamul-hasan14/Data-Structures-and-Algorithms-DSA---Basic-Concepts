# Data-Structures-and-Algorithms-DSA---Basic-Concepts
This repository contains essential Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) code that I've learned and implemented. It includes basic data structures like arrays, linked lists, stacks, queues, trees, and algorithms such as sorting, searching, and dynamic programming. This serves as a personal reference for mastering fundamental DSA concepts.
